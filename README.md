The submission done by my team in the FCG Nature Positivity Hackathon 2025 done in collaboration with LUT, with the purpose of devising a plan that would align with Lahti’s 2030 Nature Positivity goals. Collaborated with a team of 5 on the development of a risk assessment calculator web application for green roofing projects in Lahti, which would evaluate the impact a certain project would have on aspects such as biodiversity ratio, carbon dioxide intake etc., as well as eligibility for funding. My main task was related to the front-end of the application, involving the design of the calculator. 
The files for the project are included in the repositor
